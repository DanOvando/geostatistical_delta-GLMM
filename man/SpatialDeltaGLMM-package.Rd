\description{
SpatialDeltaGLMM: (1) Is an R package for implementing a spatial delta-generalized linear mixed model (delta-GLMM) for use when standardizing fishery-independent index data for U.S. West Coast surveys with (2) built in diagnostic functions and model-comparison tools, and (3) is intended to improve analysis speed, replicability, peer-review, and interpretation of index standardization methods}
